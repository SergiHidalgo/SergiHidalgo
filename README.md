👋 Hi, I’m Sergi Hidalgo a Videogame developer specialized in Unity and front-end programming. Graduated in Videogame Design and Development. In addition, I have increased and improved my knowledge in the last 5 years developing games for companies, personal and group projects that I develop to continue learning because programming video games and learning is what I enjoy the most.

I am passionate about learning and working and I am continually looking for new sources of information and inspiration.
I am a person with a lot of determination and perseverance. Since I started studying video game development, I have not stopped creating and designing new ideas. I work very well in teams and I have very good communication skills. I like to take leadership and also learn from a good leader.

Some of my most outstanding projects and achievements:
- Gudim Stories: Game that I have developed for Gudim Public, a famous artist with more than 1 million followers on instagram.
- Arctic: Serious game that I have developed for the Hardman App.
- TocYoc: Web and mobile game that I have developed for a music school in Barcelona.
- Coffin Dance The Game: Game published together with Lion Studios in the United States, +20000 downloads!
- Box Fall 3D: In the process of being published together with Voodoo for the United States.
- Kusfollin Game: Web game I developed for a beer brand in Barcelona.

Currently, I would like to find work as a Unity Developer in a company to continue learning and demonstrate what I am capable of.
